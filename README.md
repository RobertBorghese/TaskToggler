# Task Toggler

This is program that allows you to toggle whether your task-bar is set to auto-hide using a keyboard shortcut at any time. Good for those that are frequently screen-recording, but also enjoy using their task-bar when not screen-recording.

Only works on Windows.

## How to use

Run the program.
Press ALT+B to toggle.

To stop, just find it in your task manager and close it. 

## How to build

Make sure Visual Studio 2015 is installed.
Then run `Build.bat`.

Alternatively, if you have MinGW, run `gcc main.c`.

Or, like, it's only one c file. You can figure it out if none of these work for you.
